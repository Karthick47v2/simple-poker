# magic-puzzle-You-Can-Read-Minds

Simple command-line based program made for 3rd Semi module 'CO2203 Object Oriented Programming' using c++.

This is my kind of implementation for the problem **'Puzzle 3:You can read minds'**. You can view the [problem from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDHhHPZm2rc)

In addition to solving that problem, the Object Oriented Progamming stlye is maintained in the code.
